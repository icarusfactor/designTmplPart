### designTmplPart
Repository for core and extra templates &amp; parts for RoundCube Design Plugin.

### Version 1.0

Most items will be able to be set by the Design editor visual commands.
Some of the experimental ones you will need to use the HTML code option
of the editor to tweak sizes &amp; colors. This give you templates that
would be much harder to add otherwise. This repo also keeps the size of
the core Design plugin from growing out of control from template and 
parts and want to have many items here to import and use to make your
emails look amazing. 

### To import these part into RoundCube Design
 Option 1:
  Download and import them manually within visual editor in DYNAMIC
  document mode. 

 Option 2:
  Place github url into the Settings window import URL rcdt or rcdp
  entry and click left side button.

 Example Raw Github URL to put into Setting page entry. Will make a mult part file method at some point.
For group parts for styles.
